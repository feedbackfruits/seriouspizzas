> Free pizza is good. The right free pizza - even better."

## Intro 

Our team takes pizza and feedback very seriously. After having eaten our fair share of free pizza, we were very excited to be able to feed the [Dutch Ember.js community](https://www.meetup.com/Ember-js-Amsterdam/) with some pies during the 11th meetup. This is the point when we thought: "Free pizza is good. The right free pizza - even better… So lets build something that is from the community for the community and brings the right free pizza to the community!” Hence this repo where we can build it together:) 

## Who is the app for

Any community/gathering/event, that wants to feed its members with the right free pizzas or simply takes its pizzas seriously. 

## Who can contribute

- Pizza fanatics
- Ember.js fanatics
- Meetup and Communal fanatics

## What you can contribute with

code, design or feature ideas

## The goal 

Build the most epic app that takes free pizzas to another level 

## Feature ideas

### MVE 

The app should allow the free pizza eaters (FPEs) to express a preference for a specific pizza or type of pizza fro an upcoming event which they will be visiting . There should be an admin interface that allows the MOO (Master of Orders) to add items to an order menu. The FPEs should be able to access the menu and be able to submit their order for a specific event. Finally the MOO should be able to view who ordered what for the day and how many times an item was ordered all together.   

### EVP

If you would like to make FPEs lives even better we can build also additional features, e.g.: 

 - Ability for the FPEs to see his order history
 - Ability for the FPEs to make a random order
 - Ability for the FPE to order the same as another FPE of choice
 - Ability for the MOO to import whole menu lists
 - A random pizza generator (generates a pizza with random toppings) 
 - A special FPEs preferences filter, allowing to filter the menu based on food allergies and preferences (e.g. “tunas belong in the see” - item does not contain tuna, “veggie” - vegetarian option, etc.)
 - Ability for the FPEs to submit an order by tweeting
 - Any other awesome feature you can think of! 

Since we eat with our eyes presentation is important. We can use https://design.google.com/resource and https://github.com/google/material-design-lite to make the SeriousPizzas app better looking.
